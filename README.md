# Data-Analysis-Zomato
Data analysis and visualization of Zomato's restaurant dataset using SQL and Python.
📌 Introduction
Hi, I’m Suhani Gupta, a BCA graduate, Major in Data Science & ML. With a keen interest in data science, SQL, and making sense of the chaos hidden in real-world datasets. For this project, I chose to dive into the deliciously complex world of Zomato's restaurant data — not just because food is universally relatable, but because it offers a surprisingly rich playground for data analysis.With this SQL-powered exploration, my aim wasn’t just to write queries for the sake of syntax, but to extract stories: Which city truly lives to eat? Where does online delivery dominate? Which cuisines reign supreme? And how do table bookings affect ratings? Motivated by my passion to turn data into decisions and insights into impact, this project is my small but solid step toward becoming a full-fledged data analyst. Plus, let’s be honest — working with a food dataset makes debugging way more bearable. 🍕📊

📌 Zomato – A Flavorful Tech Tale
Zomato, founded in 2008, is a leading Indian tech company in the food and restaurant discovery space. It provides detailed information, digital menus, user reviews, and ratings for restaurants across the globe. Over time, Zomato evolved from just a food guide to a full-stack platform offering food delivery, table reservations, and restaurant marketing tools.

Zomato has also expanded its reach through subsidiaries and acquisitions like:

Uber Eats India (acquired in 2020)

Blinkit (for quick grocery delivery)

And stakes in various international delivery startups

While the dataset used in this project may not reflect the most current state of Zomato's global operations, it remains a rich source to explore trends, customer behavior, and regional food preferences.
The primary focus here is on crafting powerful SQL queries, drawing insights, and showcasing data manipulation skills through joins, aggregations, window functions, and filters. So even though the restaurants may not be delivering anymore — the learnings definitely are! 😄
